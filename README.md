# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis – Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using real-world purchase and supplier data.
The goal is to evaluate suppliers based on delivery, quality, and cost efficiency to help businesses make data-driven decisions when managing vendors.

The workflow includes:

1. **Data Ingestion** – Multiple raw files are uploaded and stored in a local SQLite database.
2. **Data Processing** – Data is cleaned, merged, and transformed into a final dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Trends, distributions, and relationships are explored.
4. **Dashboard Creation** – An interactive **Power BI Dashboard** is built for insights.

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Source**: 6 different CSV files (purchases, suppliers, etc.)
* **Storage**: SQLite local database
* **Final Dataset**: A single consolidated file used for EDA and dashboard

📂 **Project Data Folder (available in this repo):**

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

* Python script (`ingestion_db.py`) loads all raw files into SQLite database.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Processing

* Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting.
* Joined datasets into one **final consolidated dataset**.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Vendor performance distribution
* Top vendors by purchase value
* Late vs on-time delivery analysis
* Cost & quality trends


### 4. Power BI Dashboard

* KPIs: On-time delivery %, Quality rating, Purchase trends
* Visuals: Trend charts, bar plots, slicers, vendor comparison
